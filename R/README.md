## Notes or R-markdown

R markdown have .rmd endings

To see input and output including visualizations all together we create an HTML page.  These however can't be viewed directly by clicking files on github.  One simple way to see the html files is to paste the github URL for an html file to [https://rawgit.com/](https://rawgit.com/) and then use the production URL that produces. 

For example, clicking on the following production URL allows us to see the learn_ggplot.html file in the repo.

[https://cdn.rawgit.com/jhconning/GeoPanLearn/a598ad21/R/learn_ggplot.html](https://cdn.rawgit.com/jhconning/GeoPanLearn/a598ad21/R/learn_ggplot.html)
